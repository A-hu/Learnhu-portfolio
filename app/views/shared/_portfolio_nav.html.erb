        <p class="text-muted">With over a decade of development experience in a number of industries I realized tht teh typical product creation process between clients and developers was flawed. All too often developers rarely communicate to clients throughout the development stage, resulting in a final product that fails to reach the goal sought by the customer and end user.</p>
        <p class="text-muted">For this reason I decied to utilize a completely different developement pattern that focueses on highly focused communication and transparent design patterns. When i take on a project not only do I work to craft the application accroding to the client's specifications. I give daily updates to ensure that the project is aligning properly with the client's goals. The end result is the right product, delivered on time, and on budget.</p>
